# Findings And Recommendations:
I. The United States had the highest number of prevelent confirmed cases in 2020 while North Korea had the lowest.
II. The confirmed cases in 2022 are lower than that of 2021 because everyone has taken at least one shot of the various vaccines available in their countries and there are limited people reporting their covid19 status to their clinics or hospitals
